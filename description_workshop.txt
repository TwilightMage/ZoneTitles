This mod is an addon for BiomeTitles [url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2992680615[/url]
It allows you to designate titled areas on your own!

Let's say, you have a castle and you want a title with it's name appear when you enter this castle. With this mod you can!
First, create Zone Designator. No resources needed, only a workbench.
