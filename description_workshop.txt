This mod is an addon for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2992680615]Biome Titles[/url].
It allows you to designate titled areas on your own!

Let's say you have a castle and want to show a title when you enter that castle. With this mod you can do it!

First, create Zone Designator. No resources needed, only a workbench.
